        <h3 id="history">About us and our history</h3>

        <p class="hi">
            Nxt Museum, the young entrepreneur Merel van Helsdingen wanted to exhibit large-scale art installations,
            which are developed from interdisciplinary collaborations between established and emerging artists,
            designers, technicians, musicians and scientists. On August 29, 2020, the museum opened their doors for the
            first time in a production studio in the heart of Amsterdam. Amsterdam is ideal for discovering, creating
            and exhibiting media art, so it's perfect for a museum like this. This form of art experimented with
            technological possibilities and applications; dynamic and not bound to a form. This space would offer a
            breeding ground for this form of art; a place where different art movements and sciences come together and
            can be exhibited.

                        The Living Room installation delves into the concept of space as a living entity: a continuously
                        shifting architectural world that has its own powers of perception.

                        The digital artwork Presence and Erasure by Random International creates temporary portraits of
                        passers-by. Without the participation of the passing human bodies, the canvas is blank.

                        The work explores the global rise of QR codes, such as in China where the codes are fully
                        integrated into everyday life. From purchasing products to identifying seniors.

                        Inspired by the self-organizing movements of groups in nature. Schools of fish, flocks of birds,
                        Random International has developed ‚Äúswarm study‚Äù works of art over the course of their
                        collaborations.

                    <p>
                        Most of the stuff doesn't really make sense. Some of the rooms were really hot, because of the
                        projectors. But the visuals are really amazing. I would recommend using some weed before the
                        venue. Afterward, you can take a fairy to the city center for free.

                        We've loved several modern art museums in Amsterdam (Straat and Moco which are amazing!) and
                        looked forward to this. Unfortunately, the only compelling display was the first room. The rest
                        of the immersive and interactive art was dated or underwhelming. Not worth going.

                        Must be a better experience to visit NXT museum if you have been to a Coffeeshop in beforehand.
                        But don't go if you haven't taking anything. A nice 15 min walk from the Noorderpark metro. Saw
                        everything in 30 minutes and was way too expensive for the tickets. Free to lock up your
                        personal belongings and love the gender neutral toilets
